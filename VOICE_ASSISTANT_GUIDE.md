## ❓ Troubleshooting TTS:

### **No Voice / Silent:**

**Cause:** FreeTTS not initialized

**Solution:**
1. Check Maven dependencies downloaded
2. Look for log: `[SUCCESS] Voice assistant initialized`
3. If you see `[WARNING] Voice assistant unavailable`, TTS failed

### **Voice Too Quiet:**

**Solution:**
- Increase system volume
- Check speaker settings
- TTS uses system audio output

### **Voice Too Fast/Slow:**

Currently fixed speed. Future update will add speed control.

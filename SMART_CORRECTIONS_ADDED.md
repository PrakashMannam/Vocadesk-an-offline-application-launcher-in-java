# 🧠 Smart Corrections Added!

## ✅ What I Just Added (While You Download Better Model):

### **1. Word Corrections**
Automatically fixes common misheard words:
- "oh went" → "open"
- "oh pen" → "open"
- "crome" → "chrome"
- "krome" → "chrome"
- "spot if" → "spotify"
- "what's up" → "whatsapp"
- "such" → "search"

### **2. Fuzzy Matching**
If app name doesn't match exactly, finds closest match:
- "crom" → Suggests "Chrome"
- "spotfy" → Suggests "Spotify"
- "calcuator" → Suggests "Calculator"

### **3. Smart Suggestions**
Shows what it matched:
```
[HEARD] "oh went crome"
[CORRECTED] "open chrome"
[ACTION] Attempting to open: chrome
[SUCCESS] Launched: chrome
```

## 🎯 How It Works:

### **Example 1: Word Correction**
```
You say: "oh went chrome"
Vosk hears: "oh went chrome"
System corrects: "open chrome"
Result: Chrome opens! ✅
```

### **Example 2: Fuzzy Matching**
```
You say: "open crom"
Vosk hears: "open crom"
System matches: "chrome" (distance: 1)

```

### **Example 3: Typo Tolerance**

You say: "open spotfy"
Vosk hears: "open spotfy"
System matches: "spotify" (distance: 1)
Result: Spotify opens! ✅
```
